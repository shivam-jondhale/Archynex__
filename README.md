Archynex — AI-Powered System Architecture Builder
Live Demo: archynex.vercel.app

Archynex is a next-generation, AI-assisted system architecture design platform built to help engineers and architects quickly visualize, refine, and optimize large-scale systems. It blends intuitive diagramming with intelligent suggestions, making complex architectural decisions faster, clearer, and more reliable.

🌟 Why Archynex Stands Out
Not just diagrams — Get actionable, AI-driven advice on scaling, security, and performance. Interactive by design — Build and modify architectures visually with instant feedback. Professional outputs — Export structured, version-controlled architecture data. Real-world focus — Includes components and patterns inspired by industry best practices.
